# Technical Aspect of Sheetz

When the user creates a sheet, they also add columns, which are used as queries to be answered. The Exa API is used to get the best search results. From there, web scraping, BFS, and GPT are used to extract the relevant information to answer all the queries. If the query cannot be answered, then N/A is put in the cell. This process is repeated for each row until the user's specificed amount of rows (and all the cells) are completed.
